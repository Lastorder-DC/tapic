### Installation

Download `tapic.js` and include in your webpage via: `<script src="tapic.js"></script>`.

See `test.html` for examples on every part of tapic.js. Open up the console (F12 or ctrl-shift-i) to see the test outputs.
You will need to put in a client id and oauth token in `test.html` for it to work. 

Or install via NPM: `npm install tapic`.

See `test.js` for some examples in a node environment. As with `test.html`, you will ned to put in a client id and oauth token, and `test.html` has more in-depth usage of the library.
