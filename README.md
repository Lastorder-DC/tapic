Twitch API and Chat in Javascript. 

(Formerly known as TWAPI.js)

View the complete reference docs here: https://skhmt.github.io/tapic/

See test.html for examples on every part of tapic.js. Open up the console (F12 or ctrl-shift-i) to see the test outputs.
You will need to put in a client id and oauth token in test.html for it to work. 

Install via NPM: ``npm install tapic``.

Or download it and include in your webpage via: ``&lt;script src="tapic.js">&lt;/script>``.

This was written entirely in Javascript and has no dependencies besides ``ws`` when used in node or a relatively up-to-date browser.
